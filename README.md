# Causal-Inference-Analysis-and-Political-Attitudes-Exploration-in-Python-jupyter


This repository contains Python code for two distinct tasks: Causal Inference Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis of Political Attitudes in an IPP dataset.

## Causal Inference Analysis

The code in this section performs a causal inference analysis using regression models and various plots. It includes the estimation of the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) and visualizations of the distribution of a running variable, kernel density plots, scatter plots, and regression lines.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`, `seaborn`).
2. Adjust the file path and variable names in the code as needed.
3. Run the code for a comprehensive causal inference analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis of Political Attitudes

This section involves exploratory data analysis of political attitudes in an IPP dataset. It includes histograms of age distribution and a count plot to visualize political attitudes by gender.

### Instructions:
1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
2. Adjust the file path and variable names in the code as needed.
3. Run the code to explore the political attitudes in the IPP dataset.

Feel free to use, modify, and adapt the code for your specific needs.
